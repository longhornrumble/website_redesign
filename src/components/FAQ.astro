        q: "What exactly is MyRecruiter?",
        a: "MyRecruiter is an AI assistant trained specifically on your organization. It lives on your website and can be shared anywhere you engage supporters — emails, newsletters, social posts, or QR codes. When someone has a question or wants to get involved, it responds instantly and guides them to volunteer, donate, or learn more."
    },
    {
        q: "How long does setup take?",
        a: "Most organizations go live in 24–48 hours. We handle everything — training the assistant, configuring responses, and preparing it for your website and channels."
    },
    {
        q: "Can we approve responses before it goes live?",
        a: "Yes. You'll review exactly how the assistant answers real supporter questions before it's added to your website."
    },
    {
        q: "What if our programs change later?",
        a: "Just send us the updates. We retrain the assistant at no additional cost so your information stays accurate as your programs evolve."
    },
    {
        q: "Do you handle donations or donor data?",
        a: "No — MyRecruiter never processes or stores donation or payment information. When someone wants to donate, the assistant guides them to your existing donation platform, where the transaction happens securely outside of MyRecruiter. MyRecruiter only handles conversations — and all conversation data is encrypted in transit and at rest."
    },
    {
        q: "What if we need to change the AI's responses?",
        a: "You stay in control. Flag any response in the dashboard, and we'll update the training within 24 hours."
    },
    {
        q: "How do we deploy on other channels?",
        a: "It's easy. We provide unique links for each channel — just paste them into emails, social posts, or newsletters. You can also generate QR codes for print materials and events. It's the same assistant everywhere, with unified analytics across all channels."
    },
    {
        q: "Does MyRecruiter integrate with our CRM or case management system?",
        a: "In most cases, yes. MyRecruiter can integrate with your CRM or case management system either through a direct integration (when the platform offers an API) or via Zapier. During onboarding, we'll talk through your existing tools and handle the integration in a way that fits your workflow."
